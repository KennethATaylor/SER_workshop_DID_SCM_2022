# Pre-post designs 

Pre-post analysis (before-after) no control group: One state, two time points  
- Subset the data to California and the years 1995 and 2005  
- Preview the data  
- Plot the data  
- Fit a linear model to estimate the effect of the policy on the outcome y  
- What are potential problems  

```{r prepost}
##Create the data
dt <- mydata %>%
  filter(state=="California",
         year %in% c(1995, 2005)) 


##Preview the data
head(dt)


##Plot the data
dt %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=y, group=state, color = state)) + 
  labs(title = paste("Outcome by year"),
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Outcome",
       colour = "Treatment") +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = year_policy, lty=2) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
```

The following model is used to estimate the effect of the policy on the outcome y
```{r echo=FALSE, error=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
##fit a linear model using the post as the exposure of interest
fit <- lm(y ~ post + xi + xt + xit, data=dt)

extract_eq(fit, use_coefs = F)

fit %>% 
  tidy() %>% flextable()
```

**Potential problems**  
- The years before and after the policy have been implemented are picked arbitrarily  
- It is impossible to get standard errors  
- It is impossible to adjust for covariates  
- This model would be wrong if the parallel trend assumption is violated  
- This model would be wrong if the common shock assumption is violated  

**Conclusion**
- As expected the estimate is biased and standard errors inestimable


# Controlled pre-post designs 

Pre-post analysis (before-after) with a control group: Two states, two time points   

- Subset the data to California and Georgia and the years 1995 and 2005  
- Preview the data  
- Plot the data  
- Fit a linear model to estimate the effect of the policy on the outcome y  
- What are potential problems

fit <- lm(y ~ treated*post, data=dt) 

extract_eq(fit, use_coefs = F)

fit %>% 
  tidy() %>% flextable()
```


**Potential problems**

- The years before and after the policy have been implemented are picked arbitrarily  
- The control units are picked arbitrarily  
- It is impossible to get standard errors  
- It is impossible to adjust for covariates  
- This model would be wrong if the parallel trend assumption is violated  
- This model would be wrong if the common shock assumption is violated

# Interrupted Time Series Design  

Interupted time series: One state, Multiple time points

- Subset the data to California  
- Preview the data  
- Plot the data  
- Fit a linear model to estimate the effect of the policy on the outcome y  
- What are potential problems  


```{r its}

##Create the data
dt2 <- mydata %>% 
  filter(state=="California")

##Preview the data
head(dt2)

##Plot the data
dt2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=y, group=state, color = state)) + 
  labs(title = paste("Outcome by year"),
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Outcome",
       colour = "Treatment") +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = year_policy, lty=2) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
```


The following model is used to estimate the effect of the policy on the outcome y
```{r echo=FALSE, error=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
##Fit the model
fit <- lm(y ~ year_rec + post + post*year_rec + xi + xt + xit, data=dt2) 

extract_eq(fit, use_coefs = F)

fit %>% 
  tidy() %>% flextable()
```

**Potential problem (s)**

- This model would be wrong if the common assumption is violated(that is if an event occurs in the treated unit at or after the time of  the policy that is not attributable to the policy)

**Conclusion**
- As expected the estimate is slightly biased  



# Controlled Interrupted Time Series (CITS) or Difference-in-Difference Designs  

##  Step 1: Checking the parallel trends assumption    

Check the parallel trends assumptions  
To do so:  
- Restrict the data to the period before the policy  
- Run a linear regression of the outcome on time-varying covariates and on an interaction term between treated indicator and year  


```{r ptrends}

p_load("estimatr") #for the lm_robust() function
pretrend_data <- mydata %>% 
  filter(post == 0)

res_pretrend <-  lm(y ~ treated*year + xit + xt + xi, 
                    data = pretrend_data)
tidy(res_pretrend) %>% flextable()


#the lm_robust procedure is best because SE are correctly estimated
res_pretrend <- lm_robust(y ~ treated*year + xit, data = pretrend_data,
                          fixed_effects=state,
                          clusters = state, se_type = "stata")
tidy(res_pretrend) %>% flextable()

#Visual trends
mydata %>% 
  group_by(year, treated) %>% 
  summarise(y=mean(y),.groups="keep") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=y, group=treated, color = factor(treated))) + 
  annotate("rect", fill = "gray", alpha = 0.5,
           xmin = 2000, xmax = 2010,
           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf) +
  labs(title = paste("Outcome by year"),
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Outcome",
       colour = "Treatment") +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_discrete(labels=c("Controls", "Treated")) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = year_policy, lty=2) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
```

## Step 2: Implementing the DID analysis method  

- Fit a linear model with the treated, post and their interaction
- Don't forget to add any other time-varying covariates
- What is the regression coefficient of the interaction term

```{r did}

#Method 1: Lm_robust()
p_load("estimatr")
dta <- lm_robust(y ~ treated*post + factor(year) + xit, 
                 data = mydata,
                 fixed_effects=state,
                 clusters = state, 
                 se_type = "stata")
dta

did <- round(data.frame(ATT     = dta$coefficients["treated:post"], 
                        se      = dta$std.error["treated:post"],
                        low_ci  = dta$conf.low["treated:post"],
                        high_ci = dta$conf.hig["treated:post"]),2)
did


#Method 2: lmer(): Multilevel
fit1 <- lmerTest::lmer(y ~ treated + post + treated:post + xt + xi + xit + (1| state) + (1 | year), 
                      data = mydata, 
                      REML = T)
tidy(fit1) %>% flextable()

#Other specifications
fit2 <-  lm(y ~  xit + xi + xt + factor(state) + factor(year) + treated:post, data = mydata)
tidy(fit2) %>% flextable()

p_load("lme4", "lmerTest")
fit3 <-  lmerTest::lmer(y ~ treated:post + xit + xi + xt + (1| state) + (1 | year), 
                        data = mydata, REML = T)
tidy(fit3) %>% flextable()

```
